Jobs was also the founder of NeXT and chairman and majority shareholder of Pixar. He was a pioneer of the personal computer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s, along with his early business partner and fellow Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.\\nJobs was born in San Francisco in 1955 and adopted shortly afterwards. He attended Reed College in 1972 before withdrawing that same year. In 1974, he traveled through India, seeking enlightenment before later studying Zen Buddhism. He and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to further develop and sell Wozniak\\'s Apple I personal computer. Together, the duo gained fame and wealth a year later with production and sale of the Apple II, one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputers. \\nJobs saw the commercial potential of the Xerox Alto in 1979, which was mouse-driven and had a graphical user interface (GUI). This led to the development of the largely unsuccessful Apple Lisa in 1983, followed by the breakthrough Macintosh in 1984, the first mass-produced computer with a GUI. The Macintosh launched the desktop publishing industry in 1985 (for example, the Aldus Pagemaker) with the addition of the Apple LaserWriter, the first laser printer to feature vector graphics and PostScript.\\nIn 1985, Jobs departed Apple after a long power struggle with the company\\'s board and its then-CEO, John Sculley. That same year, Jobs took some Apple employees with him to found NeXT, a computer platform development company that specialized in computers for higher-education and business markets, serving as its CEO. In 1986, he bought the computer graphics division of Lucasfilm, which was spun off independently as Pixar. Pixar produced the first computer-animated feature film, Toy Story (1995), and became a leading animation studio, producing dozens of commercially successful and critically acclaimed films.\\nIn 1997, Jobs returned to Apple as CEO after the company\\'s acquisition of NeXT. He was largely responsible for reviving Apple, which was on the verge of bankruptcy. He worked closely with British designer Jony Ive to develop a line of products and services that had larger cultural ramifications, beginning with the \"Think different\" advertising campaign, and leading to the iMac, iTunes, Mac OS X, Apple Store, iPod, iTunes Store, iPhone, App Store, and iPad.

      "Steve Jobs was famously fired from Apple in 1985, a pivotal moment not just in his career but in the history of the technology industry. To understand the implications and context of this event, we need to look at the circumstances leading up to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the early 1980s, Steve Jobs was a co-founder of Apple Computer, Inc. and had been instrumental in the launch of the Macintosh, which was released in 1984. Despite its innovative design and user-friendly interface, the Macintosh initially struggled in the marketplace, struggling against competitors like IBM. Apple‚Äôs board of directors, concerned about the company's financial performance and market position, began to lose confidence in Jobs' leadership.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the company‚Äôs internal dynamics shifted, a power struggle unfolded. Jobs, who was known for his intense and often polarizing management style, had a tense relationship with the then-CEO, John Sculley. Originally brought in from Pepsi-Cola to help guide Apple into corporate profitability, Sculley and Jobs clashed on the direction of the company. Their philosophical differences about product innovation versus corporate strategy led to increasing tensions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The culmination of this power struggle occurred in the spring of 1985. After an unsuccessful attempt to remove Sculley from his position and regain control over Apple, Jobs was left with no choice but to resign. In a highly charged meeting, the board of directors sided with Sculley, and Jobs was effectively ousted from the company he had co-founded a decade earlier.\n",
      "\n",
      "The immediate fallout of Jobs‚Äô departure was significant. While he initially struggled to find footing outside of Apple, he eventually founded NeXT, a computer platform development company, and acquired the animation company Pixar, which would go on to become a major player in the film industry. Jobs‚Äô time away from Apple‚Äîspanning a decade‚Äîallowed him to grow as a leader and innovator. Ironically, in 1997, Apple acquired NeXT, bringing Jobs back into the fold as an advisor and ultimately leading him to reclaim his role as CEO. His return heralded a new era for Apple, marked by groundbreaking products like the iMac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, Steve Jobs was fired from Apple in 1985 due to a combination of internal conflicts, differing visions for the company, and a loss of confidence from the board of directors. This event not only reshaped Jobs‚Äô career but also had lasting implications for Apple, ultimately leading to the company‚Äôs remarkable turnaround in the late 1990s and beyond.\n"

Jobs was also the founder of NeXT and chairman and majority shareholder of Pixar. He was a pioneer of the personal computer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s, along with his early business partner and fellow Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.\\nJobs was born in San Francisco in 1955 and adopted shortly afterwards. He attended Reed College in 1972 before withdrawing that same year. In 1974, he traveled through India, seeking enlightenment before later studying Zen Buddhism. He and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to further develop and sell Wozniak\\'s Apple I personal computer. Together, the duo gained fame and wealth a year later with production and sale of the Apple II, one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputers. \\nJobs saw the commercial potential of the Xerox Alto in 1979, which was mouse-driven and had a graphical user interface (GUI). This led to the development of the largely unsuccessful Apple Lisa in 1983, followed by the breakthrough Macintosh in 1984, the first mass-produced computer with a GUI. The Macintosh launched the desktop publishing industry in 1985 (for example, the Aldus Pagemaker) with the addition of the Apple LaserWriter, the first laser printer to feature vector graphics and PostScript.\\nIn 1985, Jobs departed Apple after a long power struggle with the company\\'s board and its then-CEO, John Sculley.
